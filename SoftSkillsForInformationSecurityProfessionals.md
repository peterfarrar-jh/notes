# Soft Skills for Information Security Professionals


## Technical Skills and Soft Skills

Soft skills are tied to _Emotional Intelligence_.  

### Emotional Intelligence  

* Who are you working with?
* What motivates them?
* How can you find common ground?

Improving soft skills will help you get where you're going.

Proof Point publishes a "State of the Phish" annual report.  

1 million phish mails per day. Attackers have found a way around technical controls. They go after people.  

Soft skills help accomplish the following:  

* Education  
* Negotiation
* Representation

---

### Core Skills  

* Communication is key
* Don't be afraid to dig deep
* Keep learning
* Big-picture thinking

---

## Communication is Key

### Platinum Rule

Treat other people as they'd like to be treated.  

### Server Admin: Goals

* Build servers
* Deploy servers
* Keep servers running
* Troubleshoot servers

### How technical is your audience?  

"Developers want to talk code, server admins want to talk operating systems and virtualization, DBAs want to talk database queries, and network admins want to talk NetFlow. They don't just want to talk security."  

| Executives | Managers |
|---|---|
| High-level summary | Is the team executing well? |
| | Actionable information |


Meet your audience at their level.  
Meet them where they're at.  

_"I want to understand this from your point of view. Can you help me?"_

Three national groups to be aware of in InfoSec:  

* ISSA 
* [ISC Squared](https://www.isc2.org)
* [ISACA](https://wwwisaca.org)

Other useful organizations:

* Infragard (background check required)

Also, search for local groups.  

### Tops for Networking

* Pick a group and attend the next meeting
* Introduce yourself to at least three people
* Bring up one challenge and ask for advice
* Spend time listening to the challenges of others

---

### What Motivates Your Audience?

#### Motivators:

* Financial incentive
* Recognition
* Anonymity
* Completion

Use **multiple motivators** to appeal to different preferences.  

### Security Awareness

* Gift card for first person to report an actual phishing email.
* Let them know you'll send a list of the Top Ten Security Champions. Those who sent the most messages.
* If you fall for three or more phish mails will require training.

### One-on-One Training

Get to know the person.  

---

## Don't be Afraid to Dig Deep

Frame solutions in a way that is appropriate for your organization.  

### Compliance Standards

* HIPAA (U.S. Healthcare)
* GDPR (E.U. Privacy)

Vendors will have supporting information for explaining the needs 

### Analyst reports

* [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/products/special-reports)
* Forrester
* IDC

### Frameworks

* ISO 27001
* NIST 853

Which fix is right for your organization?  

If your company is publicly traded, read the 10K report, filed with the SEC. EDGAR, the [Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) system at the SEC.  

### Your Organization's Priorities

* What does my company do?
* How do we do it?
* Why do we do it?
* Who is our leadership team?

---

Analysis is important before responding to an issue.  

* Ask the right question - what business purpose does this analysis serve?
* Collect all the related data - technical and non-technical data
* Sort your findings
* Summarize your findings

Were you able to answer the questions they originally asked?  
Should they have asked a different questions?  

This process can be cyclical. Go through the process again as needed.  

When you find yourself in a situation with a lot of moving parts and a lot of points of view, ask yourself: What is the goal of the day?  

---

Ask yourself:  

* Who's your audience?
* Why should they care?
* How can you explain in _their_ language?

Explain why it matters and how the organization could be impacted.  

#### Speaking to Executives

* How do similar organiations stack up?
* Recent breaches and events
* Are there any patterns
* How is our program doing?

#### Detail the Implications

* Day-to-day impact
* Delays
* Complications

Words vs pictures?  

Use both.  

| Words | Pictures |
|---|---|
| Ideas | Context |
| Explanations | Emotion |

The audiences wants two things:  

1. Legit information
2. Visual engagement

---

## Keep Learning

Encourage curiosity. If you want to have better security, learn to defeat security.  

### The five whys

Keep asking why five times until you get to the answer you need.  

---

Creative thinking is encouraged. Take the idea of a picture of a door. How are you going to get to what's on the other side?  

### Capture-the-Flag (CTF) Events

Challenges where security objectives are given, and points are awarded for meeting the objective  

Look for a local DEF CON group.  

1. Identify the problem
2. There is a solution
3. Break your problem down into smaller problems
4. Brainstorm possible solutions - everything is allowed
5. Take action - Assign an owner and due date.

Find 10 solutions - how to get what's on the other side of a door.  

1. Turn knob
2. Pick lock
3. Find another way in (door window duct)
4. Remove hinges
5. Battering ram
6. Circular saw
7. Cut through wall
8. Wire to open know from other side
9. Crowbar
10. Knock off door knob

---

Balance between convenience and security  

Find ways to connect SecOps with the target audience.  

Example: Hold a hacking competition. Prizes!  

Mind Mapping Session w/ [XMind](https://www.xmind.net) or [FreeMind](https://freemind.sourceforge.net)  

Put a problem at the center and brainstorm any solutions that come to mind.  

Take a break, then repeat with a new mind map, but only use new ideas.  

Share it with someone who will tell you what they really think.  

---

### Give teaching and public speaking a try

Teaching is the highest form of ... understanding?  

What, How, Why?  

Do presentations on solutions to problems:  

1. Challenge - why does it matter
2. Process - what did you do step by step (what worked, what didn't)
3. What would you change? - based on lessons learned
4. Make a slide deck (a few on problem, 10-15 on process, a few on summary and recomendations for next step. Add resources for further study and research)

#### Preparing a Talk

* Pick a comfortable topic
* Draft a slide deck - at least 20 slides
* Contact your local ISSA chapter and ask if you can share your talk
* Look at [Security BSides](http://www.securitybsides.com)

### Risk

Threats/Vulnerabilities

Trusted VPN apps make unencrypteed WiFi less risky.  

#### Executive Risk Management

* Revenue goals
* Cash flow
* Development
* Competition

#### Risks

* What might happen?
* How bad would it be?
* Are you okay with that?
* What changes will you make?

Project implementation is tactical  
Determining which project to implement is strategic  

#### Tactical thinking:

Decision-making in response to the situation immediately in front of you  

#### Strategic Thinking

Decision-making based on the larger picture  

### Gaining the Perspective of Others

* Information security blogs
* News stories
* Reading
* Podcasts

What's going on outside of InfoSec that could influence choices  

What if... ?  

Set aside time to think about what you'll do each day.  
Set aside time to think about what you'll do each month.  
Set aside time to think about what you'll do each quarter.
